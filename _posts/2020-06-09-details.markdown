    Thanks for the tip ... but <b>when a physicist programs in FORTRAN</b>,

This quote reached me as the answer to a bug report concerning
exit codes.

A widely used, well-known, battle-tested FORTRAN simulation program for
astroparticle physics in development since the end of the 1980s had an exit code
of 0 although it exited due to an error condition.

There are a few memorable quotes from the email exchange following this bug report,
but this is the most quotable one.

The name of this blog is taken from this quote.
