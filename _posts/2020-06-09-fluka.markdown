quote: >-
    In this desolate land FLUKA was a lonely but significant exception.
    Although it was used for many years for tasks usually regarded as secondary by
    high energy physicists, it was developed with care,
    giving priority to solid physical bases rather than to graphics or other

This quote is from the introduction to a paper about a FORTRAN library
calculating particle interactions.

The paper authors specifically complain about the wrong priorities of their
contemporaries, especially the GEANT developers, who in their opinion 
lay to much focus on fancy graphics and making life easier for the users
than on what really matters: the physics.

From [A. Fassò et al, <q>FLUKA: present status and future developements</q>, 1993.](http://www.fluka.org/content/publications/1993_elba.pdf)
